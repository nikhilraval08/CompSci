HOW TO USE:

	When ran, the user is asked if they want to play or not. If they choose to play, they are prompted with a menu to choose their board size. The options are 
	4x4, 5x5, 6x6,....10x10, and random (4-26). The computer will then generate the board size (eg. 4, 5, 6) amount of ships in random locations. Each player then gets 
	to see their own boards, which are hidden from each other. 

	When the game is played, each player guesses a ship coordinate, and depending on whether they hit or missed, a sound effect will be played. The game will run until
	the opponent's board has all sunken ships.
